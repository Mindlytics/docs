### How It Works

1. **Integrate** Mindlytics via SDK or API into your AI app or agent.
2. **Capture** raw conversational events in real time.
3. **Process** interactions using AI-powered engines to decode user intent and agent performance.
4. **Visualize & Analyze** results through interactive dashboards that highlight intent fulfillment, friction hotspots, sentiment, funnels, and more.
