title: "How Mindlytics works?"
description: "Mindlytics leverages a proprietary AI engine designed to interpret user interactions with AI agents at scale. It seamlessly analyzes how users prompt the AI and how the AI responds, automatically generating real-time analytics events that capture explicit and implicit user actions, intents, traits, and emotional reactions.

These insights are visualized in the Mindlytics portalâ€”helping you understand user intent, track AI performance, measure conversational friction, and assess customer satisfaction."
