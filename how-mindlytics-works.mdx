title: "How Mindlytics works?"
description: "Mindlytics leverages a proprietary AI engine designed to interpret user interactions with AI agents at scale. It seamlessly analyzes how users prompt the AI and how the AI responds, automatically generating real-time analytics events that capture explicit and implicit user actions, intents, traits, and emotional reactions. These insights are visualized in the Mindlytics portalâ€”helping you understand user intent, track AI performance, measure conversational friction, and assess customer satisfaction."

3. **Process** interactions using mindlytics AI-powered engine to decode user intent and agent performance. Let mindlytics engine process interactions to auto generate _analytics events._ (No _event_ schema to define or keep up to date.)
4. **Visualize & Analyze** [Human-AI] engagement metrics through interactive dashboards that highlight intent fulfillment, friction hotspots, sentiment, funnels, and more.
