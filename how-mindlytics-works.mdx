title: "How Mindlytics works?"
description: "Mindlytics leverages a proprietary AI engine designed to interpret user interactions with AI agents and translate them into analytics events. It seamlessly analyzes how users prompt the AI and how the AI responds, automatically generating real-time analytics events that capture explicit and implicit user actions, intents, traits, and emotional reactions. These insights are visualized in the Mindlytics portalâ€”helping you understand user expectations, track AI performance, measure conversational friction, and assess customer satisfaction."

1. **Integrate** Mindlytics via SDK or API into your AI app or agent.
2. **Capture** raw conversations or [Human-AI] interactions in real time. Instrument the SDK to pipe user prompts and AI responses to mindlytics analytics engine.
3. **Process** interactions using  AI-powered mindlytics analytics engine to decode user intent and agent performance. Let mindlytics process interactions to auto generate _analytics events._ (No _event_ schema to define or keep up to date.)
4. **Visualize & Analyze** [Human-AI] engagement metrics through interactive dashboards that highlight intent fulfillment, friction hotspots, sentiment, funnels, and more.
