### **Intent-Driven User Insights**

Mindlytics decodes unstructured human–AI interactions to surface real user intent—tracking fulfillment rates, friction points, sentiment, and engagement patterns—insights that traditional analytics miss.

### **Conversational Effectiveness**

Measure how well your AI responds during live dialogue, including:

- Identifying where users stumble or drop off (friction)
- Tracking successful intent resolutions and conversational flow

### **AI Agent Performance**

Get granular insights into your LLM agents:

- Task completion rates
- Average response times
- Effectiveness of AI-recommended intents and attributes

### **User Segmentation & Cohorts**

Understand who your users are, how they engage, and how their behavior evolves:

- Segment users based on intent types and sentiment trends
- Compare cohorts (e.g. high conversion vs low conversion) to uncover winning strategies

### **Tailored Funnel & Journey Analysis**

Build custom funnels for AI-first flows, such as onboarding, intent pathing, upsell sequences, or autonomous agent workflows:

- Track progression, drop-offs, and conversion efficiency through every conversational step

### **Continuous Optimization & Feedback Loop**

Use Mindlytics’ real-time dashboards to:

- Identify areas of conversational friction
- Tune AI prompts and model behavior
- Increase user satisfaction and conversion with iterative, data-driven adjustments
