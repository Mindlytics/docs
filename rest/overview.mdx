## Authentication

To call REST endpoints, you must pass your workspace's api key as the bearer token in
the `Authorization` request header, and one of your project ids in a custom header named `X-App-Id`.
You can obtain these values from the Mindlytics SaaS portal.

## Errors

Errors are returned as standard HTTP errors.  You will get a status code like 400, 403, 500, etc. and the
response body will contain the error message text.
