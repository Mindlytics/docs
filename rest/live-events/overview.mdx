When you send track events to the Mindlytics service using a REST endpoint, the incoming event is sent to a processing queue and the
REST endpoint returns immediately.  This queuing architecture means there will be very little impact to your application when
using the Mindlytics service.  Depending on the type of event you are sending to Mindlytics, the processing of that event may take a little time
and may generate several new events as a result.  In some use cases it may be desirable to see these events as and when they are generated.
You can accomplish this with a websocket connection to the Mindlytics service to receive these generated events.

The way this works is that you must first use an authenticated REST call to obtain an "authorization token" and then use this authorization token in
a custom header when creating the websocket client.  Here are some usage examples:

```javascript javascript icon="node"
import Websocket from 'ws'

const MLWSEndpoint = "wss://wss.mindlytics.ai"

const wsAuthorizationToken = await getAuthorizationToken()
const wsClient = new WebSocket(MLWSEndpoint, {
    headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${wsAuthorizationToken}`,
    },
})

wsClient.on('error', (error) => {
    console.log(error.message)
})

wsClient.on('message', (message) => {
    const event = JSON.parse(message)
    console.log(event)
})
```

```python python icon="python"
import websockets
from websockets.asyncio.client import connect

ws_url = "wss://wss.mindlytics.ai"

ws_authorization_token = await get_authorization_token()
headers = [("Authorization", f"Bearer {ws_authorization_token}")]
async with connect(ws_url, additional_headers=headers) as websocket:
    async for message in websocket:
        event = json.loads(message)
        print(event)

```
