<Accordion title="Intent" description="What users want. Why are they interacting with the AI and what they hope to accomplish." icon="head-side-brain">
  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Intent Conversion Rate (ICR)" description="Measures the effectiveness of your AI agent in resolving user intents. A high ICR indicates that your agent is successfully understanding and fulfilling user goals within a conversation, signaling strong intent recognition and response quality." icon="arrow-down-from-arc">
  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="First Intent Friction (FIF)" description="Quantifies the responsiveness of your AI agent at the start of a conversation. FIF measures the time taken to resolve the user's first expressed intent. Lower friction suggests a smoother, faster onboarding experience and early user satisfaction." icon="xmark-to-slot">
  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="New Intents" description="Tracks the emergence of user intents outside the expected scope. This metric highlights the frequency and nature of unexpected or unhandled intents expressed by users, helping teams identify coverage gaps and new demand signals." icon="sparkles">
  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Intent Fulfillment Friction (IFF)" description="Measures the level of friction encountered by the AI agent when resolving user intents. Higher friction may indicate prolonged dialogues or delays in achieving intent resolution." icon="bring-front">
  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Intent Fulfillment Rate (IFR)" description="Represents the percentage of user intents successfully fulfilled by the AI agent. A higher rate signifies better agent performance in meeting user needs." icon="angle-90">
  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Intent Fulfillment Sentiment" description="The sentiment expressed by users during the process of intent fulfillment. This metric provides insights into user satisfaction and emotional tone while fulfilling user need." icon="heart-half-stroke">

<Accordion title="Intent Acceptance Rate (IAR)" description="Assesses the frequency at which users accept intent recommendations proposed by the AI agent. This metric reflects the relevance and accuracy of the agent's suggestions." icon="face-smile">
  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Attribute Acceptance Rate (AAR)" description="Measures the rate at which users accept attribute recommendations (e.g., missing information) provided by the AI agent during intent fulfillment. A higher rate indicates effective guidance by the agent." icon="face-smile-hearts">
  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Intent Fulfillment Efficiency" description="The efficiency of the AI agent in resolving user intents, considering factors like the number of interactions and time taken. This metric is inversely related to Intent Fulfillment Friction." icon="arrow-turn-left-up">
