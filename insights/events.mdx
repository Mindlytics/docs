**Events Explorer** provides a real-time, chronological view of all events generated by your application and tracked through the Mindlytics SDK. Events explorer is accessed from **Live Events** option from the leftside navigation panel. It enables developers and product teams to monitor live event streams, validate instrumentation, and inspect individual user behavior.

### How it works

The Events Explorer displays events sorted by **timestamp**, with the most recent events appearing first. Each event entry includes:

- **User ID** – the unique identifier of the user who generated the event
- **Event Name** – the name of the event as sent by the SDK
- **Timestamp** – the exact time the event was recorded by Mindlytics

The view updates automatically as new events are ingested, allowing near real-time visibility into application activity.

### Filtering events

Use the **Filter by Events** control to narrow the event stream to one or more specific event types.

- Select one or multiple event names from the dropdown to filter the view
- The dropdown is **dynamically populated** based on event names received for your application
- Filtering helps isolate specific interactions, flows, or SDK events for focused inspection

### Inspecting user activity

Clicking an event opens the corresponding **User Profile**, where you can:

- View associated **user traits** and metadata
- See a complete, time-ordered list of **all events generated by that user**
- Analyze how an individual user interacts with your application across sessions

This makes Events Explorer especially useful for debugging, instrumentation validation, and investigating specific user journeys.

### Refreshing events

The Events Explorer page is **auto-updated** to reflect newly ingested events.\
You can also manually refresh the view at any time by clicking the **Reload** icon, which retrieves the most recent events.

### Common use cases

- Verifying SDK setup and event instrumentation
- Debugging missing, delayed, or malformed events
- Monitoring real-time user activity
- Drilling down from raw events to individual user behavior
