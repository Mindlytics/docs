The **Mindlytics Portal** allows you to create, organize, and analyze charts that help you understand how users engage with your AI application. The portal supports both **precomputed human–AI engagement KPIs** and flexible **analysis charts**, enabling teams to monitor performance, explore behavior patterns, and debug interaction flows.

Charts can be created, configured, saved, and organized into dashboards for ongoing analysis. Navigation is available from the left pane, which includes **Home**, **Dashboards**, **Charts**, and **Live Events**, along with a global **Create** button.
