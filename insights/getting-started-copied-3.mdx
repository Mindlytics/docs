The **Charts** section is where you create, configure, save, and manage all analytical visualizations in Mindlytics.

### Creating charts

Click the blue **Create** button and select a chart type to begin configuration. Once created, charts can be saved and reused across dashboards.

### Chart types

Mindlytics supports two broad categories of charts:

#### KPI Charts

KPI charts display **precomputed human–AI engagement metrics** that are automatically collected and calculated by Mindlytics.

- **Conversation KPI Charts** – Metrics related to conversations, sessions, and overall interaction quality
- **Intent KPI Charts** – Metrics related to intent usage, intent success, and intent-level engagement

These KPIs require no manual configuration beyond chart selection.

#### Analysis Charts

Analysis charts allow deeper exploration of user behavior and interaction patterns:

- **Segmentation Analysis Chart** – Compare behavior across user, session, or intent segments
- **Funnel Analysis Chart** – Analyze step-by-step progression and drop-offs in interaction flows
- **Session Analysis Chart** – Understand session duration, volume, and conversational structure
- **Retention Analysis Chart** – Measure how often users return to interact with the AI
- **User Composition Analysis Chart** – Analyze the makeup of your user base across attributes and cohorts
- **Intent Distribution Analysis Chart** – Visualize how frequently different intents are expressed
- **Sentiment Analysis Chart** – Track sentiment distribution and trends over time

### Saving and accessing charts

- Any configured chart can be **saved** for reuse
- Saved charts appear under the **Charts** section in the left navigation pane
- Click a chart name to view it
- Use the **“…”** menu to delete a saved chart

### Adding charts to dashboards

- Open a saved chart
- Click **Add to** (top right)
- Select one or more dashboards

This allows charts to be reused across multiple dashboards without duplication.
