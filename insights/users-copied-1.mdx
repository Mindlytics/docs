The **User Profile** page provides a detailed, user-centric view of how an individual user is identified and how they engage with your AI application. The page is organized to answer two core questions: **who the user is** and **how the user interacts with the AI**.

### User details

The left side of the page displays all known **user traits** (attributes) for the selected user. These traits are automatically populated based on how the Mindlytics SDK is instrumented in your application.

By default, the following attributes are shown:

- **User ID** – the unique identifier for the user
- **First Seen** – the timestamp of the user’s first recorded interaction
- **Last Seen** – the timestamp of the most recent interaction
- **Last Intent** – the most recent intent expressed by the user
- **Last Known Sentiment** – the sentiment detected in the user’s latest interaction
- **Intent Count** – the total number of intents expressed by the user over their lifetime

If your application tracks additional user attributes (such as **email**, **name**, **gender**, **location**, or other domain-specific traits), they are displayed automatically in this section.

#### Avatar support

To display a user avatar, pass the reserved user trait `avatar` with a URL pointing to the image location (for example, an image hosted in an S3 bucket or your application’s backend).\
When present, the avatar is rendered automatically in the user profile.

### Activity timeline

The **Activity** section shows a chronological history of the user’s interactions with the AI, organized by **session**.

- Events are grouped by **Session ID**, making it easy to follow individual conversations
- Each event includes the **event name** and **timestamp**
- Use the **Next** and **Previous** controls at the bottom of the page to navigate through all sessions and events associated with the user

This timeline provides a clear, session-level view of how the user engages with the AI over time.

### Event details

Clicking on an event in the Activity timeline opens the **Event Details** panel on the right side of the page. This panel displays:

- **Event Name**
- **Timestamp**
- **Event Properties** associated with the event

For **custom events**, event properties are defined and sent by your application during SDK instrumentation.\
For **Mindlytics default events**, all relevant attributes are automatically captured and attached by the SDK.

### Use cases

The User Profile page can function as a lightweight, application-specific **CRM view**, enabling teams to:

- Understand individual user behavior and engagement patterns
- Debug issues by inspecting raw events and sessions
- Support customer success and investigate user-reported problems
- Validate SDK instrumentation and user trait mapping
