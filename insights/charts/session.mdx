The **Session Analysis Chart** focuses on conversational sessions rather than individual events. It helps analyze engagement depth, session structure, and conversational complexity.

This chart follows the standard **Chart Configuration Pattern**, with session-level metrics.

## What this chart answers

- How long do users typically converse with the AI?
- How many turns or events occur per session?
- How does session behavior vary by intent?

## How it works

Events are grouped by session, and metrics are computed across sessions within the selected time range.

## Examples

- **Average session duration**
  - Session duration
  - Bucket = Weekly
- **Sessions with high turn count**
  - Filter users by intent = `Troubleshooting`

This chart is useful for evaluating AI conversational quality and workload.
