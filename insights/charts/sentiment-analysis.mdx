The **Sentiment Analysis Chart** shows the emotional tone of user interactions with the AI, helping teams monitor satisfaction, frustration, and risk signals.

This chart follows the standard **Chart Configuration Pattern**, with sentiment-based aggregation.

## What this chart answers

- Are users generally satisfied or frustrated?
- How sentiment trends change over time?
- Which intents correlate with negative sentiment?

## How it works

Sentiment is automatically inferred by Mindlytics and aggregated across events, sessions, or intents.

## Examples

- **Sentiment distribution**
  - Pie chart
  - Last 30 days
- **Negative sentiment for a specific intent**
  - Shown Intent = `CancelSubscription`

This chart is especially useful for quality monitoring and customer experience analysis.
