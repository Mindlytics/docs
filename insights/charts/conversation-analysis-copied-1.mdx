title: "Chart Configuration Pattern"
---

All **Mindlytics Analysis Charts** follow a common configuration and interaction model. This pattern allows users to quickly create, modify, save, and reuse charts across different analytical use cases.

Each chart is configured using **left-side controls**, a **central visualization area**, and **top-right visualization options**.

## 1. Left-side configuration controls

The left panel defines **what data is included** in the chart and **how it is filtered**. While the exact controls may vary by chart type, they follow a consistent structure.

### Events

Defines which events are included in the analysis.

- Default: **Any Event** (includes all tracked events)
- One or more specific events can be selected
- Selected events can be filtered using **event properties**

**Example**

> Event = `Intent Informed`\
> Event Property = `source = mobile`

---

### For users

Restricts analysis to a specific set of users.

- Default: **All users**
- Filter users by:
  - User traits and values
  - Users who performed a specific event
  - Preconfigured user cohorts

**Example**

> Users where `plan = enterprise`

---

### Shown Intent

Adds intent-level context to the analysis.

- Filters events to those generated when a specific intent was expressed

**Example**

> Shown Intent = `ResetPassword`

---

### Measured as

Defines how the selected data is aggregated.

- **Uniques** – Number of unique users who generated the events
- **Totals** – Total number of events generated
- **Average** – Average number of events per user

**Example**

> Measured as = **Totals** → “How many Reset password dialog happened?”

---

## 2. Time range and bucketing

Time controls appear in the top-right of the chart display area and apply across all chart types.

- Bucket data **daily**, **weekly**, or **monthly**
- Choose a custom start and end date
- Or select predefined ranges such as **7d**, **30d**, or **60d**

**Example**

> Daily buckets over the last 7 days

---

## 3. Visualization options

Users can control how the data is rendered.

- Select **Line** or **Bar** or \*\*Pie \*\*chart (where applicable)
- Visualization updates instantly as configuration changes

---

## 4. Chart metadata and saving

At the top of the chart display area, users can configure metadata for reuse and sharing.

- **Chart name** (required to save)
- **Optional description** for context

Saved charts:

- Appear under the **Charts** section in the left navigation
- Can be added to one or more dashboards
- Can be deleted using the **“…”** menu

---

## 5. Summary metrics and underlying data

Below the chart title, Mindlytics displays **pre-calculated summary values** for the selected dataset.

At the bottom of the chart display area, the **underlying data table** used to render the chart is shown.

- Enables export or copy/paste
- Ensures transparency between visualization and raw data
