title: "Intent Insights"

The **Intent Insights** chart offers a focused lens into your AI agent's performance at the intent levelâ€” revealing how effectively it understands, recommends, and fulfills user needs. Drawing from best practices in conversational analytics, this dashboard compiles multiple intent-focused metrics into a single view, helping you to measure quality and optimize outcomes. 

**1. Intent Fulfillment Friction (IFF) :** Measures the level of friction encountered by the AI agent when resolving user intents. Higher friction may indicate prolonged dialogues or delays in achieving intent resolution.

**2. Intent Fulfillment Rate (IFR):** Represents the percentage of user intents successfully fulfilled by the AI agent. A higher rate signifies better agent performance in meeting user needs.

**3. Intent Fulfillment Sentiment:** Evaluates the sentiment expressed by users during the process of intent fulfillment. This metric provides insights into user satisfaction and emotional tone while fulfilling user need.

**4. Intent Acceptance Rate (IAR) :** Assesses the frequency at which users accept intent recommendations proposed by the AI agent. This metric reflects the relevance and accuracy of the agent's suggestions.

**5. Attribute Acceptance Rate (AAR) :** Measures the rate at which users accept attribute recommendations (e.g., missing information) provided by the AI agent during intent fulfillment. A higher rate indicates effective guidance by the agent.

**6. Intent Fulfillment Efficiency:** Evaluates the efficiency of the AI agent in resolving user intents, considering factors like the number of interactions and time taken. This metric is inversely related to Intent Fulfillment Friction.
