The **Conversation Insights** chart in Mindlytics provides a comprehensive view of conversational performance by combining multiple KPIs into a single, powerful dashboard. Mindlytics extracts insights from natural language interactions between your users and AI into actionable metrics.

With this chart, you can analyse:

**1. Intent Conversion Rate (ICR)**\
_Measures the effectiveness of your AI agent in resolving user intents._\
A high ICR indicates that your agent is successfully understanding and fulfilling user goals within a conversation, signaling strong intent recognition and response quality.

**2. First Intent Friction (FIF)**\
_Quantifies the responsiveness of your AI agent at the start of a conversation._\
FIF measures the time taken to resolve the user's first expressed intent. Lower friction suggests a smoother, faster onboarding experience and early user satisfaction.

**3. New Intents**\
_Tracks the emergence of user intents outside the expected scope._\
This metric highlights the frequency and nature of unexpected or unhandled intents expressed by users, helping teams identify coverage gaps and new demand signals.

**4. Sentiment**\
_Assesses user sentiment during interactions with the AI agent._\
Derived from user language and behavior, this metric reflects how positively or negatively users feel while engaging with the agent—providing insight into user satisfaction and emotional tone.

**5. AI-Human Engagement Duration**\
_Analyzes how long users actively engage with the AI agent per session._\
This KPI captures the duration of conversations, offering a view into session depth and sustained user interest or complexity of task resolution.

**6. Prompts per Engagement**\
_Indicates the average number of messages exchanged between the user and AI agent per session._\
This helps evaluate interaction density—whether conversations are concise and effective or prolonged and potentially inefficient.
