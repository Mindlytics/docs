The **User Composition Analysis Chart** shows how your user base is distributed across attributes, cohorts, or behaviors. It provides a structural view of _who your users are_.

This chart follows the standard **Chart Configuration Pattern**, focused on user attributes.

## What this chart answers

- What percentage of users belong to each cohort?
- How users are distributed across regions, plans, or behaviors?
- How user makeup changes over time?

## Examples

- **User distribution by country**
  - User trait = `country`
- **New vs returning users**
  - User cohort = lifecycle stage

This chart is ideal for audience analysis and segmentation strategy.
