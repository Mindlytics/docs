The **Funnel Analysis Chart** visualizes how users progress through a defined sequence of steps and where they drop off. It is used to measure conversion, completion, and friction in AI-driven workflows.

This chart follows the standard **Chart Configuration Pattern** with ordered steps.

## What this chart answers

- Where do users drop off in a conversational flow?
- How many users complete a task after expressing an intent?
- Which steps introduce the most friction?

## How it works

You define an ordered list of events that represent steps in a flow. Mindlytics computes conversion rates and drop-offs between each step.

## Examples

- **Booking flow conversion**
  - Step 1: `conversation_started`
  - Step 2: `intent_detected (BookAppointment)`
  - Step 3: `slot_selected`
  - Step 4: `booking_confirmed`
- **Support resolution flow**
  - Step 1: `intent_detected`
  - Step 2: `ai_response_sent`
  - Step 3: `issue_resolved`

Use this chart to optimize task success and reduce abandonment.
