The **Segmentation Analysis Chart** allows you to break down events by users, intents, and time to understand _who is doing what_ in your AI application. It is the most flexible analysis chart in Mindlytics and is commonly used for exploratory analysis, validation, and trend monitoring.

This chart follows the standard **Chart Configuration Pattern**.

## What this chart answers

- How many users performed a specific action?
- How event volume changes over time for a given cohort?
- How engagement differs by intent, user attribute, or time window?

## How it works

You select one or more events, optionally filter them by user traits and intent context, choose how results are measured, and visualize trends over time.

## Examples

- **Unique users sending messages per day**
  - Event = `message_sent`
  - Measured as = **Uniques**
  - Bucket = Daily, Last 7 days
- **Total API calls for a specific intent**
  - Event = `api_call`
  - Shown Intent = `TrackOrder`
  - Measured as = **Totals**
- **Average number of prompts per user**
  - Event = `prompt_sent`
  - Measured as = **Average**
