The **Retention Analysis Chart** measures how often users return to interact with the AI over time. It highlights stickiness and long-term engagement patterns.

This chart follows the standard [**Chart Configuration Pattern**](https://developer.mindlytics.ai/insights/charts/conversation-analysis-copied-1) with cohort-based time tracking.

## What this chart answers

- Do users return after their first interaction?
- How retention changes across cohorts?
- Which intents drive repeat usage?

## How it works

Users are grouped into cohorts based on their first interaction date, and repeat engagement is tracked over subsequent time buckets.

## Examples

- **7-day retention**
  - Cohort = First interaction date
  - Bucket = Daily
- **Retention by intent**
  - Shown Intent = `AccountManagement`

Use this chart to assess adoption and long-term value.
