The **Intent Distribution Analysis Chart** visualizes how frequently different intents are expressed by users. It highlights demand patterns and intent concentration.

This chart follows the standard [**Chart Configuration Pattern**](https://developer.mindlytics.ai/insights/charts/conversation-analysis-copied-1), centered on intent metrics.

## What this chart answers

- What users are trying to do most often?
- Which intents dominate overall usage?
- How intent mix changes over time?

## How it works

Mindlytics aggregates intent occurrences and displays their relative or absolute frequency.

## Examples

- **Top intents in last 30 days**
  - Bucket = Monthly
  - Measured as = **Totals**
- **Unique users per intent**
  - Measured as = **Uniques**

Use this chart to guide intent optimization and roadmap decisions.
