**Users Explorer** provides a real-time, searchable view of users interacting with your AI application. It helps developers and product teams understand user-level engagement, inspect recent interactions, and analyze how individual users experience the AI agent.

### Default view

The Users Explorer displays a list of users with key engagement and interaction attributes, including:

- **User ID** – the unique identifier of the user
- **Last Seen** – the timestamp of the user’s most recent interaction
- **Last Intent** – the intent detected in the user’s most recent interaction with the AI
- **Last Sentiment** – the sentiment associated with the user’s most recent interaction
- **Conversation Count** – the total number of conversations the user has had with the AI agent

The list is updated automatically as new interactions occur, ensuring up-to-date visibility into user activity.

### Customizing displayed attributes

You can tailor the Users Explorer table to show only the user attributes relevant to your analysis.

- Click **Configure Display** (top right) to select or deselect user traits
- Add or remove any tracked **user traits** from the table columns
- Changes apply instantly, allowing flexible exploration without modifying tracking configuration

This enables teams to adapt the view for debugging, customer support, or deeper behavioral analysis.

### Searching users

Use the **Search** field to quickly find specific users based on any tracked user trait.

- Search by **User ID**, **name**, or any other user attribute being tracked
- Search operates across all available user traits, not just visible columns
- Useful for locating individual users, validating identity mapping, or investigating specific cases

### Drilling into user profiles

Clicking a user opens the **User Profile**, where you can:

- View the complete set of user traits and metadata
- See a chronological list of all events and interactions generated by the user
- Analyze the user’s full interaction history across sessions and conversations

### Common use cases

- Monitoring user engagement and activity at the individual level
- Investigating user-specific issues or anomalies
- Validating user traits and identity resolution
- Supporting customer success and debugging workflows
